Cityio is agnostic to what kind of data stored in its self, the restrictions are
1. a valid JSON format
2. does not interfere with reserved field names `{'meta', 'header', 'clear', 'update'}`

For further data format specifications, the CityScope community is organizing standalization on the data scheme. A good place to start is [here](https://github.com/CityScope/cityscope.github.io/wiki).
