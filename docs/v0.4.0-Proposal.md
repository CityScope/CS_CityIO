# Auth

## 1. (not ready)sign up
```
POST https://cityio.media.mit.edu/users/signup
```

## 2. login
```
POST https://cityio.media.mit.edu/users/authenticate
```

required header:
```
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
[Base64](https://www.base64encode.org) encoding with `username:password` format.

this will return a json data like this 
```
{
  token:"whateveritis"
}
```

## 3. read/write private tables

tentative rule:

if the table data has `"user":"username"` in the header, like shown below,
```
{
  "header":{
    "user":"username"
  }
  "meta": {
  ...
  }
  grid: [...]
  .
  .
  .
}
```

it needs an additional header info such as
```
Authorization: Bearer whateveritis
```

# Discussion

1. Overall ergonomics, coordination with frontend
2. Will have the db ready for the next release
3. Access rights for the modules
4. Table data structure
